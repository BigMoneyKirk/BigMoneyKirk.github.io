# MessingAround
An attempt to make my Kirkland Enterprises website, but this is the template. I don't take this one as seriously as my previous ventures.

This site has been coming along so nicely, and at an exponential rate! I love it. I have been developing from my two personal laptops (The
Alienware mostly, and the x360 HP Spectra). I have been praying for insight with the direction of the application as well. The Lord has
been showing me some pretty fascinating stuff!

The Word of God, social media, journaling, connecting, loving, sharing, caring, growing, developing. This application will have it all!
